In cancer research, it is crucial to identify the stable states and measure the evolution process based on experimental observations. Furthermore, discovering the mechanisms underlying cancer progression is an important issue, as it will help us better understand cancer, providing valuable insights. We employ MuTrans, a data-driven energy landscape approach, to analyze the dynamic evolution of cancer. We introduce two quantitative indicators to study critical shifts in cancer evolution, including cancer onset and progression, and identify critical genes involved in these transitions.

MATLAB & python environment.

KIRC input data:
microarray data: KIRC_data.csv

Running for KIRC dynamic:  cancer_KIRC.py in KIRC folder
You can follow the python code in cancer_KIRC.py to generate the result, including attractor of sample, landscape of KIRC and so on.
Remark: You should take the folder to your desktop.
